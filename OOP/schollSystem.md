# A SCHOOL SYSTEM WITH:

---
    - Students > has a name, age and grade
    - Teacher > has a name, subject, and can teach
    - Schol > can add students and teachers, and show them

---

## The project teaches me:
    - Clases & objects  (students, teachers and school)
    - Encapsulation (data inside each class)
    - Composition (schol has teachers and students)
    - Methods (like get_info, add_students)
